Can you take a look at the Monte_Carlo.ipynb notebook and help me with the following tasks? 

I want to have a clean (new notebook) version of the code that is well organized and easy to read. I want it in such a way that it loads an excel file from the input folder and processes it 
Then I want the same metrics and graphs, but in a more organized way.
